# Machine Learning Intro Tensorflow & scikit-learn

Files in this repository demonstrates a basic Machine Learning examples using scikit-learn and Tensorflow Library

# Files & Features 

- [x] DecisionTree - decisiontree.py 
- Supervised Learning by making use of Decision Tree Classifier and its fit algorithm to predict whether the given
features belong to Apple or Orange

- [x] Avoid using unnecessary feature - goodfeature.py
- Unnecessary features such as corelated features must be avoided because it hurts the accuracy of the algorithm

- [x] Learning is to adjust the parameters of the model using training data pipeline.py 
- Using the straight line equation we adjust the parameter slope and y intercept to adjust the model using training data.
